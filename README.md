# Escape-from-Grandmas-House
The Simpson's Escape from Grandma's House Adaptation with Phaser 3

=== INFRASTRUCTURE ==

+2 The game runs/executes without critical errors or crashes

+3 The project has a well-maintained and updated GitHub page

=== LOOK & FEEL ===

+5 The game includes 
    -(1) a title screen, 
    - (2) some means to view credits, 
    - (3) some means of completion/conclusion, 
    - (4) the ability to restart from within the game, and 
    - (5) in-game instructions/tutorial that allow the player to learn the game's premise and controls

+10 Your game has artistic cohesion, i.e. the art, sound, typography, etc. reflect your target media's aesthetic goals

=== TECHNICAL EXECUTION ===

+5 Your game uses at least five of Phaser's major components, which may include: 
    - physics systems, cameras, 
    - particle effects, 
    - text objects, 
    - the animation manager, 
    - the tween manager, 
    - timers, tilemaps, pipeline FX, etc. (Please list these components in your main.js file.)

+10 Your game has mechanical cohesion, i.e. the mechanics reflect your adaptation's technical goals, the game controls and performs as expected, and the mechanics are well-implemented.

+5 Your project and code are well-structured and organized, including legible comments, appropriate data structures, sensible prefabs, meaningful variable names, logical scene structures, etc. (Nathan's examples are a good baseline.)

=== POLISH & STYLE ===

+5 Your game has that extra bit of polish, creativity, technical prowess, and/or originality that helps it stand out from other games. We use this criteria as a grade "tilt" to reward games that we really enjoyed, that are bold and inventive, that adapt their target media thoughtfully, that demonstrate strong technical skills, and/or went beyond the stated objectives of the assignment. Feel free to add a comment to your main.js/Canvas submission if you wish to point out any features that we might miss.
