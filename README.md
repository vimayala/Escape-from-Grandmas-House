# Escape-from-Grandmas-House
The Simpson's Escape from Grandma's House Adaptation with Phaser 3

- [X] Basic Scene structure: You have defined Scenes (yes, plural) and some means to switch between them (e.g., via in-game actions, temporary key presses, etc.).  (1 point)
    - Space for Menu -> Play, S for Play -> Street
- [X] Player interaction: The player can interact with the game. You should have at least one primary mechanic operational. If you make a platformer, perhaps movement and jumping are implemented. If you make a narrative game, perhaps the dialog boxes are implemented. If you're making a hidden object game, perhaps the basic point/click verbs are implemented. Primary mechanics will vary from game to game. (1 point)
    - Grandson is able to shoot
    - Grandson is able to jump
- [X] Temporary visual assets: What good are core loops and interactions if there is nothing to look at? These should be assets in place, even if they are geometric primitives, quick doodles, or magazine cutouts. (1 point)
- [X] Temporary sound assets: Don't leave decisions about sound until the end of the design process. Sound is integral to making a game feel "real." Make sure your game makes some noise. (1 point)
- [X] Code organization and hygiene: Be sure you're using good software engineering practices, including version control (git/GitHub), code commenting, code encapsulation (Scenes, prefabs, etc.), and other quality-of-life features (e.g., indenting, logical variable names, etc.). It doesn't have to be perfect, but a grader should be able to look at your GitHub repository and understand how your code is structured and how it works. (1 point)
